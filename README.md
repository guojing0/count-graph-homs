# count-graph-hom: Yes we count!

Caption: DALL-E is not good at spelling...

The `count-graph-hom` library is the first implementation of the homomorphism counting algorithm from "[Homomorphisms Are a Good Basis for Counting Small Subgraphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01595)" by Radu Curticapean, Holger Dell, and DÃ¡niel Marx that is 100% compatible with [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/).

The library is designed to be efficient, accurate, and user-friendly, making it ideal for students and researchers who want to incorporate graph homomorphism counting into their work. The code is commented and documented, so that it is potentially useful for educational purposes.

For people who are curious about *graph homomorphisms*, you are invited to read [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_homomorphism) to get started!

### Installation

The developer is working towards merging the code into the SageMath codebase, so that users could use it dierctly in SageMath.

The current recommended way to use `count-graph-hom` is from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/guojing0/count-graph-homs.git
cd count-graph-homs
sage -n
```

After running the above commands, you should see a SageMath (Jupyter) notebook open in your browser. Please see [tutorial.ipynb](/tutorial.ipynb) for future steps to get started.
